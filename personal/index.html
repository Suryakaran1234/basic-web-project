          <h2>"The Benevolent Goblin"</h2>


          <span>by Gesta Romanorum</span>

          <p>
            In the kingdom of England there is a hillock in the midst of a dense
            wood. Thither in old days knights and their followers were wont to
            repair when tired and thirsty after the chase. When one of their
            number called out, "I thirst!" there immediately started up a Goblin
            with a cheerful countenance, clad in a crimson robe, and bearing in
            his outstretched hand a large drinking-horn richly ornamented with
            gold and precious jewels, and full of the most delicious, unknown
            beverage.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Goblin presented the horn to the thirsty knight, who drank and
            instantly felt refreshed and cool. After the drinker had emptied the
            horn, the Goblin offered a silken napkin to wipe the mouth. Then,
            without waiting to be thanked, the strange creature vanished as
            suddenly as he had come.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now once there was a knight of churlish nature, who was hunting
            alone in those parts. Feeling thirsty and fatigued, he visited the
            hillock and cried out:
          </p>

          <p>"I thirst!"</p>

          <p>Instantly the Goblin appeared and presented the horn.</p>

          <p>
            When the knight had drained it of its delicious beverage, instead of
            returning the horn, he thrust it into his bosom, and rode hastily
            away.
          </p>

          <p>
            He boasted far and wide of his deed, and his feudal lord hearing
            thereof caused him to be bound and cast into prison; then fearing
            lest he, too, might become partaker in the theft and ingratitude of
            the knight, the lord presented the jeweled horn to the King of
            England, who carefully preserved it among the royal treasures. But
            never again did the benevolent Goblin return to the hillock in the
            wood.
